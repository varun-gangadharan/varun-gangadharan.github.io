                                        <p class="project-description">
                                            This research presents a novel application of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for monitoring foot traffic in public spaces. Utilizing BLE broadcasting capabilities and RSSI measurements, the study develops a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for traffic analysis. The system, comprising a broadcaster and an observer, overcomes challenges like MAC address rotation and broadcasting speed optimization. Extensive testing on different BLE platforms, including the nRF5340 and Adafruit Feather, demonstrates the system's efficacy in various scenarios. This work contributes to BLE technology applications in unconventional settings and has potential in event management, retail, and health crisis scenarios.
